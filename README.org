* Usage
** enable modes
   There are 2 emacs major mode for sequence file formats:
   1. `fasta-mode`: fasta file
   2. `genbank-mode`: genbank file

   Besides major mode, seqel implements 2 minor modes for DNA/RNA (`nuc-mode`) and protein (`pro-mode`) sequences, respectively.

   For both major modes, seqel will automatically determine whether it is nucleotide or protein sequences and turn on the corresponding minor mode.
